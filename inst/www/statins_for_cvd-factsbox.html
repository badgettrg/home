            <p>The guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommend taking statin if your risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) within 10 years is 7.5% or more or if you have diabetes or if you already have CVD.

				<div id="ACA_AHA" class="is_tip">&quot;4 major statin benefit groups were identified for whom the ASCVD risk reduction clearly outweighs the risk of adverse events based on a strong body of evidence. These are 1) secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD, 2) primary prevention in individuals with primary elevations of LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, 3) primary prevention in individuals with diabetes 40 to 75 years of age who have LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL, and 4) primary prevention in individual without diabetes and with estimated 10-year ASCVD risk ≥7.5%, 40 to 75 years of age who have LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL. Moderate evidence supports the use of statins for primary prevention in individuals with 5% to <7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk, 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL. Selected individuals with <5% 10-year ASCVD risk, or <40 or >75 years of age may also benefit from statin therapy.&quot;(<a href="http://pubmed.gov/24222016" title="Click to display source at PubMed in a new window" target="_blank" class="citation">American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, 2013</a>&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openRules/openRules.github.io/master/images/External.svg.png" width="13" alt="opens in new window"/>)</div></li>
