Clinical Prediction Rules
====

These clinical prediction rules are available online at this [link](https://public.opencpu.org/ocpu/github/openrules/home/www/) at [openCPU](https://public.opencpu.org/). The underlying programming code is open-source here at GitHub.com.

[Clinical prediction rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_prediction_rule) are becoming integral to medical practice. Recent, important rules include:
*  [New Pooled Cohort ASCVD Risk Equations](http://pubmed.gov/24222018) for the 2013 ACC/AHA Guidelines to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk
*  [Mayo Clinic model for prediction of malignancy in patients with noncalcified pulmonary nodules](http://pubmed.gov/23649456) for the Diagnosis and Management of Lung Cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines
*  [NASBP2 calculator for breast cancer risk accessment](http://pubmed.gov/10491430) for 2016 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guideline for breast cancer screening and 2013 USPSTF Breast Cancer: Medications for Risk Reduction. 

The [Source code](https://github.com/openrules) here at GitHub is available:
   * Feel free to add new rules and improve existing rules
   * These pages may not function on older  versions of Internet Explorer.
 
Future plans could include connecting these rules to electronic health records (EHRs) using the [InfoButton standard](http://www.openinfobutton.org/). Using the example of the cardiovascular risk model above, connecting the model and EHRs would allow creation of prompts to alert health care providers which patients are at high risk of cardiovascular disease and would benefit from treatment of risk factors.
